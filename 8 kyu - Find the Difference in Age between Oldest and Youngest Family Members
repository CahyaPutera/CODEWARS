## Description:
# At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age 
# and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.

# You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. 
# The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. 
# Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].
