# The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. 
# Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. 
# An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

# Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

# Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

# Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

# Examples:
# tickets([25, 25, 50]) # => YES 
# tickets([25, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
# tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change (you can't make two bills of 25 from one of 50)
